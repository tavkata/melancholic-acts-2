Nobody liked Saban. He had walked into a dark room, ripped off his shirt and found himself at the epicentre of a video montage, rendering himself susceptible to violent street attacks. The kind of aggression that you would never expect existed. Or at least, not towards yourself. The kind of aggression that leaves your self questioning its own existence and who you think you really are. Are you the product of what others make you? Or both? Saban had always tried to stay away from violence. He did not take well to confrontation. Usually, he would let something build up, expanding outwards further and furthermore until it would eventually explode. All hell would break loose. At that moment. And a single moment is all it takes to end a world.
